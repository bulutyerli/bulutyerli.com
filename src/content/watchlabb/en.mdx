# Watchlabb

Watchlabb is a project I developed for Vision Ventures. It’s a platform where users can list their luxury watches for sale or create real-time auctions. As the sole full-stack developer at the company, I was responsible for building the entire project — from front-end to back-end, project architecture to DevOps.

## Project Purpose

Watchlabb was built to provide a secure marketplace for watch buyers and sellers. The platform allows users to list their watches for sale or participate in real-time auctions, but most importantly, every user and watch is verified by editors before being listed.
As the sole developer of the project, I implemented TC identity number verification, SMS verification for both users and admins, and a system requiring watch images to show a random time generated by the listing form. These features ensure that each listing is authentic and reduce the risk of fraud.

## Stack & Features

I chose tools and technologies that were modern, scalable, and allowed me to implement custom features efficiently:

- Frontend: Built with Next.js + React, styled with Tailwind CSS. Implemented sliders, drag-and-drop uploads, and image galleries for a rich UX.
- Backend & Database: Powered by Supabase (PostgreSQL) for authentication, database, and storage. Implemented custom queries and server-side logic for auctions, listings, and verification workflows. RBAC ensures secure role-based access for users, admins, and editors.
- Authentication & Verification: Core auth created via Supabase Auth but also implemented my own custom SMS verification system with local sms provider and TC identity number verification.
- Payments & Billing: Integrated Iyzico for payments and Parasut for billing, fully automated via webhooks and cron jobs.
- Real-Time Features: Live auctions with automatic auction-end handling and bid updates using Supabase Realtime.
- Notifications & Emails: Automated emails and alerts for account verification, auctions, bids, and transactions using React Email + Resend.
- PDF & QR Code Generation: Automatic creation of invoices, sold watch certificates, and unique QR codes using PDF-lib and qrcode.
- Charts & Data Visualization: Built statistics and financial charts for user and admin dashboards, including listings and auction data, using Recharts.
- Rate Limiting: Implemented rate limiting on resource-intensive queries and requests to ensure system performance and prevent abuse.
- DevOps & Deployment: Implemented a staging environment for testing new features before production. All deployments are automated with GitHub Actions and PostgreSQL migrations, ensuring smooth and reliable releases.

## Challenges

I faced several challenges while developing Watchlabb. As a production-grade platform with real users, the main goal was to build a secure and scalable system. One of the most important features, real-time watch auctions, required a reliable and responsive system to handle bids and auction endings automatically.

Another significant challenge was creating an automated billing system that processes transactions in order while respecting the rate limits of payment providers. Since the platform heavily relies on high-quality images, caching and rate limiting were also critical to ensure smooth performance.

Overcoming these challenges strengthened my ability to design and implement complex, reliable, and scalable systems for production environments.

## Lessons Learned

Working on Watchlabb reinforced the importance of building systems that are reliable, secure, and maintainable from day one.

- End-to-End Thinking: Handling both front-end and back-end development for a live platform showed me how decisions in one part of the system affect the others.
- Designing for Scale: Real-time auctions and thousands of users required careful planning of database queries, caching, and background processes.
- Balancing Security and UX: Implementing verification systems taught me how to make security measures strong without hurting user experience.
- Automation & Reliability: Building automated payment, billing, and notification workflows showed the value of reducing manual work while keeping the system dependable.
- Production Readiness: Managing deployments, staging environments, and migrations reinforced best practices for launching and maintaining a live product.

These lessons helped me sharpen my architectural and problem-solving skills, showing how to deliver complex, production-ready applications efficiently.
